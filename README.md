# Issues
Contributors are welcomed. Please make a pull request

* Browser is locked when loading comments. Currently script runs every 0.8 secs and clicks on the load more comments button. Need a way to load the comments faster without getting detected by Facebook.
* Error detection is minimal. Better error detections are welcomed
* Facebook uses React to render components, therefore most of the jquery selectors look meaningless. Better jquery selectors would be nice.
